## A Note on Notetaking

# from Office of Graduate Research Fliders University, youtube, "Vlog 18 Note taking during a PhD"


1. Dont confuse taking notes with highlighting photocopies.

2. Separate writing of notes with platform you are reading from (e.g. read on ipad, take notes on laptop).

3. Every topic of interest has separate file on computer. Organize by subject, not date or author.

4. Ensure references are acurately logged. 

5. Ensure you type notes accurately. Legibility gives you longevity. Presenting research to your future self. 

6. Write down argument that is being presented in article in one sentence. 
	
	- Read intro, conclusion, abstract, take a breath, don't look at it, write one sentence about why this research matters. 
	
	- Then write second sentence, how that research will be useful to you.

7.   Look at bibliography/reference list first to calibrate scholarship of article. 
	
	- Using high quality scholarship?

	- What journals and books used?

	- Obsessed with self-citation?? (this is bad)

	- mixing analogue and digital sources

8. Copy down quotations accurately. Differentiate between your own interpretation, paraphrasign, and quotations!!

	- Paraphrase as default, unless if how researcher is portraying their research is important, then quote.

	- Differentiate between the two!!

9. Ensure notes are sufficiently detailed so you do not have to return to original article.
	
	- be succinct, but detailed enough 

10. Ensure notes are sufficiently brief so you haven't paraphrased entire article. 

	- Aire on the side of brevity.
