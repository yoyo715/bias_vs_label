INtro:

- explain problem
- then why twitter
- why predict gender in first place
- no info - gender important for other research
- get rid of the 6610 profiles

What so special?:
- hand labeled costly
- dont introduce what they did yet

Related Work:
one slide
	- gender prediction
	- distance supervision
		- label colleciton methods:
			- manual label	
			- distance
				- expalin the limitations of the related work
	- get rid of the first three points

Methodology:3 slides ( new way to generate, gender prediction model/instances, hypothesis)
- what did they do?
- they poropose a new way to generate labels
- slide for what model they use and what instances look like
- move model archi to methodolgy

Hypothesis: -- in methodolgy part
- more efficien
- same amount of accuracy model
- labels collected are still acurate also

Experiments:
	-"data collection"
		- rather than distant labels - say self-reported
	- clarify what they mean by collecting tweets within one week
	- create figure?
	- move "advantages of this method" to methodolgy part - maybe jsut get rid of it

	- change "manual evalustion" to data cleaning + manual eval on self-reports of gnere
	- explain why and how filters
		- split to two slides
		- evaluate accuracy 
		- filter
		- flipping gender

- colect data
- data cleaning

- experimental design:
	- split to trina and test
	- how did they split?
	- did they run mult times?

	- prepocessint 

	- then comparing datasets
	- how to compare (evaluation metrics)

	- ran 20 times
	- ran one model on three datasets
	- add the majority and lexicon 

Results:
- make figure larger -- accuracy of dataset- show accuracy of label sets 

- how efficinet 

Conclusiot: -- move overview to the conclusion
